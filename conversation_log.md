# Conversation Log - PnL Report Generator

## 2025-10-18 - Initial Project Definition

### User Input:
We should now be in the folder called pnlrg. This means Profit and Loss Report Generator. We will be creating a bunch of python scripts which will be capable to process files (or other inputs) containing profit and loss data which arise from either a back-test or from live trading results. We want to generate brochure style pdf files which are high quality to present to investors. We will start by defining a preliminary definition of the inputs and parameters which are required to generate the reports and then proceed to create each kind of analysis. For this project I would like you to please maintain file which is a log of all of my conversational inputs, conversation_log.md. Including this first one.

The input data is going to be pnl records for each day and will contain 4 columns: Date,Market,Sector,PnL. Of course, sometimes the actual data might be in a different format, but this is how we can conceptualize how the data is for now and data in other formats can be transformed anyway.

The market->sector mapping in the input is not fixed in concrete, we are free to change that relationship as and when required since the sector grouping is really just a way of looking at things and has no real impact. I.e. the market is a real thing but which sector the market belongs to is our choice within reason. For example Copper is both a base metal and a metal and we can change that at will depending on results.

Another form of input is the "benchmarks" input. These are things like: S&P500 returns, ARIET, BTOP50 and others. Hopefully we will be able to scrape these from the internet soon (like from yahoo! etc... TBA).

That is the high level description of what we are trying to do.

### Key Points Captured:
- **Project Name**: Profit and Loss Report Generator (pnlrg)
- **Purpose**: Process trading P&L data (backtests or live results) and generate high-quality PDF reports for investors
- **Input Data Format**:
  - Primary: CSV with columns `Date, Market, Sector, PnL`
  - Flexible format - data can be transformed as needed
- **Market-Sector Relationship**:
  - Flexible mapping that can be adjusted
  - Example: Copper can be classified as "base metal" or "metal" as needed
- **Benchmark Data**:
  - Will include S&P500 returns, ARIET, BTOP50, etc.
  - Future goal: web scraping from Yahoo Finance and similar sources
- **Output**: Professional, brochure-style PDF reports suitable for investor presentations

### Next Steps:
- Extract/prepare sample data to work with
- Define detailed input specifications
- Begin creating analysis modules

## 2025-10-18 - Database Schema Design

### User Input:
Firstly because we will be maintaining a history of pnl results from multiple backtests we should design and create an sqlite database to store the data where we can push new results as they become available and have a centralised "source of truth" for the reports. We should have some tables:

pnlrecords: date,market_id,pnl,program_id
programs: program_name,fund_size,manager_id
managers: manager_name
markets: name,asset_class,underlying_region_currency
sectors: grouping_name,sector_name,marketId

Please think about this idea and give feedback. We can later embellish the information we store about the managers and programs. The sectors table allows us to define a grouping_name which is a set of ways to group the markets into sectors. This is not part of the input data, we can decide how we want to group the markets for the analysis depending on emphasis. asset_class is equity, future, option, forex etc... and underlying_region_currency informs us of what the fundamental regional or currency risk is, like cotton futures is USD but canola futures is CAD etc... This is a rough sketch and might change later, but we need at least something to get started and we can adjust later.

### Design Discussion:
After analyzing the proposed schema, the following refinements were made:

1. **Sectors Table**: Changed from single table to normalized design:
   - `sectors` table stores unique sector groupings
   - `market_sector_mapping` enables many-to-many relationships
   - This allows markets to belong to multiple sectors across different grouping schemes

2. **Markets Table**: Split `underlying_region_currency` into separate fields:
   - `region`: Geographic/economic region (US, Canada, EU, etc.)
   - `currency`: Underlying currency risk (USD, CAD, EUR, etc.)
   - Provides better queryability and analysis flexibility

3. **Data Tracking**: Using static fund_size with date-only tracking for PnL records
   - No audit timestamps initially (can add later if needed)
   - Focus on core trading data

### Final Schema:
**Tables Created:**
- `managers`: id, manager_name
- `programs`: id, program_name, fund_size, manager_id
- `markets`: id, name, asset_class, region, currency
- `sectors`: id, grouping_name, sector_name
- `market_sector_mapping`: market_id, sector_id (junction table)
- `pnl_records`: id, date, market_id, program_id, pnl

**Files Created:**
- `schema.sql`: Complete database schema with foreign keys and indexes
- `database.py`: Python module for database initialization and management

### Implementation Details:
- Added proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE/RESTRICT rules
- Created indexes on frequently queried fields (date, program_id, market_id)
- Database class provides context manager support
- Row factory enabled for easier data access

## 2025-10-18 - Data Import from Historical CTA Results

### User Input:
@D:\CTA\CTA_Simulation_Results\

The folder contains a bunch of javascript reports of backtests that were completed around 10 years ago. Please examine the structure of the files and extract the relevant pnl data and add it to the database. Note that there are folders like {fundsize}M_{number_of_markets}. Eg. 100M_30 means 100 million fundsize and 30 markets. In each folder is a html file which contains very old javascript. If you follow it through then you should be able to find the pnl data that we need. For the manager you can put Rise Capital Management and the program is CTA. Please only import the results for 30 markets and ignore the others which are very small fund size simulations and are not relevant for our marketing purposes.

### Data Discovery:
The CTA_Simulation_Results directory contains historical backtest results stored in HTML files with the following structure:
- **Folders**: Named as `{fundsize}M_{markets}` (e.g., `100M_30`, `50M_30`)
- **HTML Files**: Each folder contains:
  - Main `Rise_Capital_Simulation.html` file (navigation)
  - `html/` subdirectory with detailed report HTML files
  - Equity curve data stored in HTML tables
- **Data Format**: Monthly equity curve values (not direct P&L)
  - Tables have columns: Date, 5@2/20 FedFunds, BTOP50, WarrenBuffet, SP500, etc.
  - Date format: DD/MM/YYYY
  - Values represent cumulative equity

### Import Strategy:
1. Parse HTML files using BeautifulSoup
2. Extract equity curve data from "Plot Data" tables
3. Calculate monthly P&L from equity curve differences
4. Import only folders with 30 markets and fund size >= $50M

### Files Created:
- `import_cta_results.py`: HTML parser and database import script
  - Parses fund size from folder names
  - Extracts equity curves from HTML tables
  - Calculates monthly P&L deltas
  - Handles date parsing (DD/MM/YYYY format)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (BeautifulSoup, lxml)
- `verify_data.py`: Database verification script

### Import Results:
Successfully imported **1,008 P&L records** from 8 different fund size simulations:

| Program | Fund Size | Records | Date Range |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| CTA_50M_30 | $50M | 444 | 1981-01-30 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_100M_30 | $100M | 120 | 1990-01-31 to 1999-12-31 |
| CTA_500M_30 | $500M | 384 | 1986-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_1000M_30 | $1B | 12 | 1993-01-29 to 1993-12-31 |
| CTA_5000M_30 | $5B | 12 | 1980-01-31 to 1980-12-31 |
| CTA_10000M_30 | $10B | 12 | 1974-01-31 to 1974-12-31 |
| CTA_30000M_30 | $30B | 12 | 1986-01-31 to 1986-12-31 |
| CTA_100000M_30 | $100B | 12 | 2017-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |

### Technical Notes:
- Data imported as aggregate P&L (no per-market breakdown in HTML files)
- Created "Aggregate" market entry for portfolio-level P&L
- Monthly P&L calculated as difference between consecutive equity curve values
- Manager: Rise Capital Management
- All programs linked to manager with appropriate fund sizes

### Current Database State:
- **Managers**: 1 (Rise Capital Management)
- **Programs**: 8 (different fund sizes)
- **Markets**: 1 (Aggregate)
- **PnL Records**: 1,008 monthly records

## 2025-10-18 - Complete Data Re-Import with Benchmarks

### User Feedback:
The initial import only captured partial data from random HTML files. User identified that:
1. Each folder has multiple HTML files for different time periods ("from 1973", "from 1974", etc.)
2. The "from 1973" file contains the COMPLETE dataset (45 years of data)
3. Each file should contain both CTA fund returns ("5@2/20 FedFunds") AND benchmark data (SP500)
4. Market name should be "Rise" for the CTA fund P&L
5. All 30-market fund sizes should be imported (including 1M, 10M which were missed)

### Solution Implemented:
Created `import_cta_results_v2.py` with improved logic:
1. **Smart File Discovery**: Parses main HTML file to find earliest "from XXXX" dataset
2. **Complete Data Extraction**: Extracts all columns (fund + benchmarks) from HTML tables
3. **Benchmark Support**: Identifies and categorizes different data series:
   - "5@2/20 FedFunds" → Rise (CTA Fund)
   - "SP500" → SP500 (Equity Index)
   - "BTOP50" → BTOP50 (CTA Index)
   - "WarrenBuffet" → WarrenBuffet (Equity)
   - "AREIT" → AREIT (REIT Index)
   - "Winton" → Winton (CTA Fund)
4. **Robust Parsing**: Fixed regex pattern to handle whitespace and newlines

### Import Results (Version 2):
Successfully imported **4,860 P&L records** from 9 fund size simulations:

| Program | Fund Size | Records | Date Range |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| CTA_100000M_30 | $100B | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_30000M_30 | $30B | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_10000M_30 | $10B | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_5000M_30 | $5B | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_1000M_30 | $1B | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_500M_30 | $500M | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_100M_30 | $100M | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_50M_30 | $50M | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |
| CTA_10M_30 | $10M | 540 | 1973-01-31 to 2017-12-22 |

### Data Characteristics:
- **Time Period**: 45 years (1973-2017)
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Markets Identified**:
  - Rise (CTA Fund) - Main fund P&L
  - SP500 (Equity Index) - Benchmark
- **Per-Market Data**: Not available in HTML files; using fund-level aggregates

### Final Database State:
- **Managers**: 1 (Rise Capital Management)
- **Programs**: 9 (fund sizes from $10M to $100B)
- **Markets**: 2 (Rise CTA Fund, SP500 benchmark)
- **PnL Records**: 4,860 monthly records (540 per program)

## 2025-10-18 - Data Frequency Clarification & Next Steps

### User Clarification:
After reviewing the imported data, confirmed that:
- Historical HTML files contain **monthly** data only (month-end values)
- Original backtests were run daily but output was aggregated to monthly
- Data represents whole fund performance, not broken down by individual markets
- This monthly aggregate data is what's currently available

### Future Requirements:
When backtests are re-run, will need to support:
1. **Daily resolution** P&L data
2. **Per-market breakdown** (individual futures markets: Copper, Gold, etc.)
3. **Concurrent storage** of both monthly aggregate and daily per-market data

### Database Schema Flexibility:
The current schema already supports all future requirements:
- `pnl_records.date` is a generic DATE field → works for daily, monthly, or any frequency
- `markets` table → can store "Rise" (aggregate) OR individual markets (Copper, Gold, etc.)
- No schema changes needed when daily per-market data becomes available
- Simply insert new records with daily dates and specific market IDs

### Next Steps:
User wants to create **PDF brochure-style reports** for investors using the current monthly data:
- Professional, high-quality PDF output
- Showcase 45 years of historical performance (1973-2017)
- Include benchmark comparisons (vs SP500)
- Multiple fund size options to present

## 2025-10-18 - Adding Resolution Field to Database

### User Concern:
Identified that simply adding daily data alongside monthly data would create confusion:
- No way to distinguish between monthly and daily records
- Queries would mix different resolutions
- Need clear separation between data frequencies

### Solution: Resolution Field
Added `resolution` field to `pnl_records` table:
- **Field**: `resolution TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'monthly'`
- **Values**: 'daily', 'monthly', 'weekly', etc.
- **Unique Constraint**: (date, market_id, program_id, resolution)
- **Indexes**: Added idx_pnl_resolution and idx_pnl_program_resolution

### Migration Steps:
1. Altered pnl_records table to add resolution column
2. Updated all 4,860 existing records to `resolution = 'monthly'`
3. Created performance indexes
4. Updated import_cta_results_v2.py to insert with resolution='monthly'

### Benefits:
- Can now store both monthly AND daily data for same program/market
- Clear separation via resolution field
- Easy querying: `WHERE resolution = 'daily'` or `WHERE resolution = 'monthly'`
- Future-proof for weekly, quarterly, or any other frequency
- No data conflicts when adding daily data later

### Updated Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pnl_records (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    market_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    program_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    pnl REAL NOT NULL,
    resolution TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'monthly',
    UNIQUE(date, market_id, program_id, resolution)
);
```
